        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Verdon is a graduate of Regis High School in New York City and Fordham University. 
           His initial career was in the advertising industry in New York City, where he worked 
           on the creative sides of several large agencies. After his retirement from advertising,
           he and his wife decided to leave the city and move to a rural area in the western foothills
           of the Catskill Mountains.In his first pursuit after leaving the city he designed and built
           Shaker-style furniture—a career he pursued for the next ten years. He also became a fan of 
           classic detective stories, in all their varieties from Arthur Conan Doyle to Ross Macdonald 
           to Reginald Hill.His wife, Naomi, inspired him to write his own mystery novel. Two years 
           later he completed Think of a Number. Its subsequent success in the marketplace, as well as 
           with critics, persuaded him to write a second novel, Shut Your Eyes Tight, featuring the
           same central characters. That was the beginning of a series of crime thrillers featuring 
           retired NYPD homicide detective, Dave Gurney. The books in the series have been translated 
           into more than two dozen language

        <h2>Think of a Number</h2>
        <p>
            The first book in the Dave Gurney series, Think of a Number is a heart-pounding game of cat
            and mouse that grows relentlessly darker and more frightening as its pace 
            acceleratesThreatening letters arrive in the mail over a period of weeks, ending with a 
            simple declaration: “Think of any number . . . picture it . . . now see how well I know 
            your secrets.” Those who comply find that the letter writer has predicted their random 
            choice exactly. But when oddities that begin as a diverting puzzle quickly ignite into a 
            massive serial murder investigation, police are confronted with a baffling killer, one who
            is fond of rhymes filled with threats and warnings, whose attention to detail is 
            unprecedented, and who has an uncanny knack for disappearing into thin air.Brought in as
            an investigative consultant, Dave Gurney, a recently retired NYPD homicide investigator,
            soon accomplishes deductive breakthroughs that leave local police in awe. Yet, even as 
            he matches wits with his seemingly clairvoyant opponent, Gurney’s tragedy-marred past 
            rises up to haunt him, his marriage approaches a dangerous precipice, and he wonders 
            if he’s met an adversary who can’t be stopped.A work that defies easy labels—at once a 
            propulsive masterpiece of suspense and an absorbing immersion in the lives of characters 
            so real we seem to hear their heartbeats—Think of a Number is a novel you’ll not soon forget.
